//! Set of traits used to trace RTOS internals.
//! 
//! # Features
//! 
//! - `trace_impl`: Activates tracing function (on by default). Can be used by 
//!    the RTOS to deactivate tracing.
//! 
//! # Implementation
//! 
//! The backend is required implement [`RtosTrace].
//! 
//! Existing implementation:
//! - [SEGGER SystemView](https://docs.rs/systemview-target/)
//! 
//! # Usage
//! 
//! ## RTOS
//! 
//! The RTOS can implement [`RtosTraceOSCallbacks`] to provide additional 
//! information upon request from the tracing software. For example:
//! ```ignore
//! rtos_trace::global_os_callbacks!{Scheduler}
//! 
//! impl rtos_trace::RtosTraceOSCallbacks for Scheduler {
//!     fn task_list() {
//!         /*..*/
//!         for task in tasks.iter() {
//!             trace::task_send_info(task.id(), task.info());
//!         }
//!     }
//!     /*..*/
//! }
//! ```
//! 
//! Usage for the RTOS maintainer is simple:
//! ```ignore
//! use rtos_trace::{RtosTrace, trace}
//! 
//! pub fn spawn_task(/*..*/) {
//!     /*..*/
//!     trace::task_new(task_id);
//! }
//! ```
//! 
//! ## Application
//! 
//! Similar to a global logger the user must provide a tracing backend, i.e.:
//! ```Ã¬gnore
//! use systemview_target::SystemView;
//! rtos_trace::global_trace!{SystemView}
//! ```
//! 
//! The user can implement [`RtosTraceApplicationCallbacks`] to provide 
//! additional information upon request from the tracing software. For example:
//! ```ignore
//! struct Application;
//! rtos_trace::global_application_callbacks!{Application}
//! 
//! impl rtos_trace::RtosTraceApplicationCallbacks for Application {
//!     fn system_description() {
//!         systemview_target::send_system_desc_app_name!("Espresso Machine");
//!         systemview_target::send_system_desc_device!("STM32F769NI");
//!         systemview_target::send_system_desc_core!("Cortex-M7");
//!         systemview_target::send_system_desc_os!("Bern RTOS");
//!         systemview_target::send_system_desc_interrupt!(15, "SysTick");
//!     }
//!     /*..*/
//! }
//! 
//! ```
